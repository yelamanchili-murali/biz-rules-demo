Demo steps:

1. With the file `USER_STORY.md` file open in the IDEA, enter the prompt `Generate the Java classes the implements the user story`.
2. The step above should generate a `CostCalculator` class or similar with a placeholder for `calculateCost` (or similar) method.
3. Implement the decision table logic in the `calculateCost()` method.
4. Can I use a table-driven approach to `calculateCost()` to minimise the use of if-else?
5. A reverse engineering use case -> Assuming we lost the docs or user story is out of date. Enter the prompt `Can you extract the decision table from this code block?` to generate the decision table from code.
